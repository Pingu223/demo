Kiaroscuro is a website ==(strongly avoding the word "blog" here, open to suggestions)==

Right so here we go, description: Kiaroscuro is a portal ==(community?)== featuring ==(doesnt sound right)== social criticism and fiction ==(or social critiscism in the form of fiction/prose/short stories/thoughts?)==. Kiaroscuro in essence is a cabinet of thoughts that were put into (prose? sounds a bit too fancy)... ==(to be continued)==

you know what? We need to ponder on WILL this thing actually be, we managed to get this shit going so quick i didint really have time to th0nk on all this.

to do:

-begin the creative **PRÃ–CESS**
 
-show me had to add new posts

-show me how to highlight things? like in yellow, just change text colours to be able to seperate ideas from actual things on the website</p>

-add paragraph spaces (think i got it?)

-have a drunk brainstorm crunch

-remove herobrine
